@government
go-to: menu

The German Republic, called by some of our detractors as the "Weimar Republic", is a parliamentary republic with a somewhat weak president and a strong parliament, called the Reichstag. The Reichstag is responsible for governing, while the President has a largely ceremonial role but also has some important governing responsibilities.

The Reichstag is elected based on a proportional representation system, giving parties seats roughly proportional to their vote share in each electoral district. The Reichstag then elects the Chancellor and the cabinet by a majority vote, who are responsible for government. A majority vote-of-no-confidence can remove the current government.

The President is elected by a national direct vote, in two rounds. The second round is used if the first round does not result in a majority for one candidate; the candidate who receives a plurality in the second round becomes president (there is no obligation for weaker candidates to drop out). The role of the president is mostly to represent Germany, but he also has some crucial governing powers. The president and chancellor can together use emergency decrees to govern, bypassing the Reichstag. The president can also appoint or remove a chancellor when a parliamentary majority is unable to be established, and can thus influence the formation of a government.

Germany is divided into a number of states, each of which have their own governments with some responsibilities. By far the largest and most important state is Prussia.

= Timeline of the SPD and the Empire (until 1935)

**1875**: The SPD is formed as a merger of the General German Workers' Association, founded by Ferdinand Lassalle, and the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany, led by Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel. Eventually, the SPD grows to become the largest party in the German Empire.

**1914**: The Great War begins. The SPD votes in favor of war credits, with substantial internal dissent. This begins a policy of *Burgfriedenspolitik*, a general peace between all political parties and trade unions.

**1917**: The USPD, a left-wing anti-war split from the SPD, is formed. Zentrum, FVP (social liberals) and SPD form the Inter-Faction Committee (IFA), advocating for liberalisation and a swift end to the war. 

**1918**: Due to prolonged food shortages and war exhaustion, a wave of unrest and following failed socialist uprisings known as September Insurrections rocks the German Empire, leading to clashes between disorganized revolutionaries and recalled frontline soldiers.

**1919**: Germany claims victory in the Weltkrieg, becoming a hegemon on the world stage.

**1920**: A failed attempt at installing a military dictatorship results in resignations of Erich Ludendorff and Paul von Hindenburg, the most influential generals in the german military. A constitutional reform is passed through the Reichstag, marking a shift from the old Bismarckian Constitution to a new March Constitution, establishing more partisan control over the government. A "March Coalition", consisting of Zentrum, FVP and SPD forms after the election.

**1922**: The SPD adopts the Liegnitz Program as its party platform.

**1931**: Austrian Creditanstalt Crisis happens when evil ass building says "government is out of money" (if we keepin it a reichsmark, we ass).

**Demographic Groups**

**Working Class**: The urban working class - blue-collar workers in factories, workshops, mines, and the like. Most are socialist, supporting either the SPD or KPD. They make up 40-50% of the population.

**Old Mittelstand**: The old middle class consists of independent artisans, shopkeepers, and small-time businesspeople. They tend to be conservative and are the strongest base for the far right. 10-15% of the population.

**New Mittelstand**: The new middle class consists of white-collar workers and government employees. This is the base of liberalism. 10-15% of the population.

**Rural**: Small and large farmers and independent rural workers. Protestant farmers often support the DNVP. 20-30% of the population.

**Catholics** are the largest religious minority, at about 30% of the population. They disproportionately support the Center Party (or the Bavarian People's Party in Bavaria).

**Jews** account for between 0.5% to 1% of the population, and tend to support liberal parties, mostly the DDP, although substantial numbers support the SPD or KPD.
