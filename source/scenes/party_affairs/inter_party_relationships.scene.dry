#subtitle: Building relations with the other political parties of Germany.

= Inter-Party Relationships

The SPD cannot govern by itself yet. Because we do not have an electoral majority, we need the support of other parties. Recently, our governments have consisted of the Weimar Coalition of the SPD, Center, and Democratic parties. We can reach out and build additional connections with these parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.

- @liberals: Strengthen our bonds with the Liberal People's Party.
- @center: Strengthen our bonds with Zentrum, center-right pro-democratic party.
- @minority_and_agrarians: Reach out to Minority Bloc and Agrarians, moderately influential in rural and border areas.
# - @kpd: Work towards improving relations with the Socialist Party.
- @call_for_democracy: Rally democratic parties to abolish Schleicher's government and form a ruling coalition .
- @spd_alone: The SPD can stand alone for now.

The communists are suspicious of our overtures, especially the Stalinist leadership, who persist in calling us "social fascists". However, connections are made at the grassroots and local levels.

@kpd_rectification_of_history

One stumbling block for our relations with the KPD is our history of conflict, dating back to 1918 and 1919. The KPD is especially contemptuous of Gustav Noske, the SPD "bloodhound" who reportedly ordered the violent suppression of the Spartacist uprising and other KPD revolts. They also blame us for the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, two SPD-turned-KPD leaders who were killed during the suppression of the uprising.

For further improvements in KPD relations, it might be necessary to expel Noske, and hold some sort of commemoration for Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

- @yes_history: Yes, we must apologize for our past actions.

As part of normalizing relations with the KPD, we have to acknowledge the wrongdoings of our past. We have expelled Noske, and have held public commemorations for those killed by troops during the uprisings.

This leads to tensions with the moderates and reformists within our party, and criticism from the conservative and liberal parties.

@no_history
on-arrival: kpd_relation -= 3

We have no need to apologize for the actions of Ebert and Noske; it is the Communists' fault for launching a violent insurrection.

After the success of the coalition government with the KPD, they are much more amenable to us.

@kpd_blutmai
on-arrival: kpd_relation += 3*(1 - dissent); staatspolitiker_dissent += 1

After the events of BlÃ¼tmai, reconciling with the Communists is difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, we must try.

@center_op
on-arrival: z_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

We are currently in "permanent opposition" against Zentrum and their allies, making it difficult to mend relations.

@center_coalition
on-arrival: z_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)

We are currently coalition partners with them, so improving relations comes naturally.

Appointment of Schleicher by Wilhelm II has caused turmoil in the parliament, making it easy for us to rally democratic parties of the Reichstag around us.

The LVP has been one of our closest allies through the course of the Republic.

Growing opposition against the german democracy makes it easier to reach common ground between our parties.

Whether it is because we *cannot* or *will not*, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.
