= Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its voter base. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @workers: The urban working class, our traditional support base.

@workers
subtitle: -1 resources
choose-if: resources >= 1
unavailable-subtitle: Not enough resources.
on-arrival: workers_spd += 6*(1-dissent); workers_spd -= 2 if unemployed >= 15; workers_spd -= 2 if unemployed >= 25; workers_spd += 6*(1-dissent) if wtb_adopted = 1; resources -= 1; workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent) if nationalization_progress >= 1;

We have increased our campaigning among the workers. [? if unemployed >= 15: The high levels of unemployment make our campaign more difficult. ?][? if wtb_adopted = 1 : Adopting the WTB plan gives us a new rallying point around which to attract workers. ?]
