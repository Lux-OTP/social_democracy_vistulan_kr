= Schleicher Kabinett fucking explodes

In a surprising turn of events, our lord and savior Boris Savinkov showed up in Berlin today wielding a steel chair, and with the words "I am quite fond of Red Tsar from Prussia" he threw it at the general direction of the decrepit fool Schleicher, obliterating him in a nuclear explosion. Kaiser Wilhelm II has been faced with a difficult choice: make Otto Braun the Red Tsar of Germany or face the second steel chair cast by the vozhd with god's grace

- @old_man_yields: Savinkov saves the day, as always

@old_man_yields

Kaiser decided to save his life and made Otto Braun the most powerful man in Germany. Another day, another banger.
