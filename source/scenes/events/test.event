= The Schleicher Kabinett has been blown up by Boris Savinkov

In an outstanding move, Boris Savinkov has channeled his inner gamer energy and nuked the reactionary red general, expressing that "he's quite fond of the Red Tsar of Prussia", thus making the Kaiser face a difficult choice: make Otto Braun the Red Tsar from Prussia that all of the RedAutumnists have always dreamed of or share the dumb, incompetent bastard's fate.

The Kaiser accepts, and Social Democracy reigns eternal in the name of our Lord, Terrorist and Savior
