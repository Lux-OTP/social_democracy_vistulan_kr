= The Dusseldorf Agreement

Following prolonged and exhaustive talks between [+ chancellor +] cabinet and the strike committees, a satisfying compromise has been signed in the city of Dusseldorf.

Despite the tensions between workers and the police, [? if rfb_militancy >= 0.44 : resulting in outbursts of violence in some places,  ?]negotiations proceeded peacefully and in a surprisingly cordial atmosphere, and at the end of the day...

- @good_dusseldorf: ...the workers' representatives secured wide array of concessions from the government.
- @mid_dusseldorf: ...both sides met in the middle of the road.
- @bad_dusseldorf: ...the strike has failed to achieve many of its initial goals.
