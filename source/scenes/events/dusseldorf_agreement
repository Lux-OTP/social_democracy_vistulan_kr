= The Dusseldorf Agreement

Following prolonged and exhaustive talks between [+ chancellor +] cabinet and the strike committees, a satisfying compromise has been signed in the city of Dusseldorf.

[? if year == 1936 : Owing to labor's resolve in face of the economic crisis, the workers found themselves in a strong position during the negotiations. ?]
[? if year == 1937 : Despite the strike becoming an increasingly harsh burden to the workers, they have held their line so far and took an assertive stance throughout the negotiations. ?]
[? if year == 1938 : Prolonged economic hardship and rising fears of an intervention by the german armed forces have made calls for a quick end to the strike increasingly common. As a result, government delegates took a harsh line throughtout the negotiations. ?]
[? if year >= 1939 : The strike has largely died out by now, and the agreement is more or less an act of capitulation in face of an inevitable government crackdown. ?]

Despite the tensions between workers and the police, [? if rfb_militancy >= 0.44 : resulting in outbursts of violence in some places,  ?]negotiations proceeded surprisingly peacefully, and at the end of the day...

- @good_dusseldorf: ...the workers' representatives secured wide array of concessions from the government.
- @mid_dusseldorf: ...both sides met in the middle of the road.
- @bad_dusseldorf: ...the strike has failed to achieve many of its initial goals.
