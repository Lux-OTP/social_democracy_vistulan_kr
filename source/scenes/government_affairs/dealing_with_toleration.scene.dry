= Dealing with Schleicher

Even though the SPD isn't a part of the ruling coalition, we still hold a sizeable sway within the Reichstag, and can use it to influence the current government.

Are we sure about this? A vote of no confidence could trigger new elections should we fail to find a majority, and as a result - allow nationalist parties to increase in vote-share.

- @vonc: Yes, we will bring down the current bourgeois cabinet.
- @stay_course: No, we can't take the risk just yet.

We have called for a vote of no confidence, and brought down this government. Unless we can present a workable majority to [+ president +], new election will have to be called.

@stay_course

Whether it's because we don't want to join the government in the current state of affairs, or we don't have enough support in the parliament to fully succeed, we decide that we can't make such a fateful decision just yet.

We approach chancellor [+ chancellor +] and offer to support a few of the most tolerable policies proposed by his cabinet, should some of our bills enjoy the government's backing in return. Some of our members decry this move, stating we're better off just letting the disfunctional government erode instead.

We manage to convince the incumbent chancellor to cooperate. We secure Center's assurances of improvements to workplace safety and legal protections of the workers, in return for granting limited benefits to religious schools.

Despite some protests from both sides, a deal like that ultimately helps mend relations between our parties, and slightly improves the workers' livelihood.

We have successfully negotiated concessions for the workers striking in the Ruhr! This has slightly cooled the atmosphere of the demonstrations. However, some particularly staunch reactionaries of the ruling coalition see it as giving in to syndicalist demands, and are growing frustrated with cooperating with us.

@urge_failure
on-arrival: jungturken_strength += 5; labor_strength += 5; rfb_militancy += 0.05

Unfortunately, our negotiations have met with failure. The [+ chancellor +] cabinet sees us as merely a "different shade of syndicalist red" and won't consider our offers. The workers react to the news with fury. violence remains on the rise.
