= Dealing with Schleicher

Even though the SPD isn't a part of the ruling coalition, we still hold a sizeable sway within the Reichstag. We may be able to use it in our favour.

Are we sure about this? A vote of no confidence could trigger new elections should we fail to find a majority, and as a result - allow nationalist parties to increase in vote-share.

- @stay_course: No, we can't take the risk just yet.

We have called for a vote of no confidence, and brought down this government. Unless we can present a workable majority to [+ president +], new election will have to be called.

@stay_course

Whether it's because we don't want to join the government in the current state of affairs, or we don't have enough support in the parliament to fully succeed, we decide that we can't make such a fateful decision just yet.

We have successfully negotiated concessions for the workers striking in the Ruhr! This has slightly cooled the atmosphere of the demonstrations, showing

Unfortunately, our negotiations have met with failure. The Schleicher cabinet sees us as merely a "different shade of syndicalist red" and doesn't want to listen to us.
